          <h1>Functional Music to Improve <span>Focus in 15 minutes</span></h1>
          <p>
            Our science-first approach creates music that sounds different-and
            affects your brain differently-than any other music.

          <h2>Patented Technology</h2>
          <p>
            Brain.fm holds patents on key processes for creating functional
            music, including technology to elicit
            <span>strong neural phase locking </span>--allowing populations of
            neurons to engage in various kinds of coordinated activity-and
            technology to remove distraction in sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            This makes our music unique, purpose-built to steer vou into a
            desired mental state. In other words, we've found new ways to create
            music that helps you do what you need to do.

          <h2>Tested on Brain and Behavior</h2>
          <p>
            Scientists at Brain.fm work with collaborators at academic
            institutions to run experiments.
          </p>
          <p>
            We look at the effects of our technology on the brain, using MRI and
            EEG, and also run large-scale behavioral tests, measuring
            performance on simple games.
          </p>

            of the same underlying music without Brain.fm technology applied, so
            we can be sure our tech is what makes the difference
